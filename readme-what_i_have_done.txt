recently i added a function of fully customizable 



first i cropped many data and collected in DataCollection folder
then created Augmented Data in AugmentedData folder
final touched data is stored in Training folder
i made one dir for watermark but data is too less

work in utils.py, data-development.ipynb




next i train a classification model using residualnet18 architecure (resnet18)
now here i ran out of time (i have much better ideas before like yolo or sliding windows)
i was also thinking about semantic segmentation (not possible on such small data and also need someone for labelling) or training anchor boxes for yolo algorithm but time is limited
(i selectected 3 models and deleted rest of them)

work in modelDevelopment.ipynb, modelValidation.ipynb




next i final the work my own simple technique for object detection

results in objectDetection.ipynb
